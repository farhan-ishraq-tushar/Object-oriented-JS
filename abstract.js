// abstraction -> Restriction of the creation of object of the 'parent' class.

/*
    In OOP Keyword "abstract" is used for class abstraction.
    You can not create object for abstract class.
    Abstract class always needs its inherited child class to perform.
    But in JS this process is not allowed
